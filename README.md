# applesentimentanalysis
This project involves building a prediction algorithm to assess reviews of Apple products based on tweets(from X).
Key Components:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned tweet data using regular expressions and stemming techniques.
Feature Extraction: Utilized TextBlob for sentiment analysis and extracted features such as polarity from the tweets.
Visualization: Created visualizations of the extracted features with Seaborn's count plot.
Model Training: Performed vectorization of the data and trained multiple machine learning models.
Evaluation: Compared model performance using confusion matrices and classification reports. Enhanced model accuracy through Hyperparameter Tuning.
User Interface: Developed a front-end graphical user interface with Tkinter, allowing users to input tweets and receive sentiment predictions.
Explore this repository to see how sentiment analysis and machine learning can be applied to social media data for product reviews.
